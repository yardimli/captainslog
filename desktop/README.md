# Total Log Desktop

This is the Tauri 2 + Rust desktop sensor for Total Log. It currently provides:

- foreground Windows application, executable path, and window-title detection;
- Windows idle-time detection;
- a tray icon that keeps monitoring after the settings window closes;
- dedicated desktop-sensor pairing with the Laravel application;
- local foreground-application sampling with one aggregated upload every five minutes while the computer is active;
- per-application totals for the last five minutes, last hour, and today;
- a dedicated Kindle Cloud Reader window whose Amazon session remains in WebView2;
- manual Kindle library capture that logs the first displayed book's title and author without collecting reading position;
- a loopback-only bridge for the optional browser extension, which forwards exact browser domains and synchronized mobile Chrome history using the desktop app's pairing key.

## Windows prerequisites

1. In **Visual Studio Installer**, modify your Visual Studio installation and select **Desktop development with C++**. Keep the MSVC build tools and Windows 10/11 SDK components selected.
2. Install Rust with `winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup`, restart PowerShell, then run `rustup default stable-msvc`.
3. WebView2 is normally already installed on current Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. If it is missing, install the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime.
4. For MSI builds, ensure the Windows optional feature **VBSCRIPT** is enabled.

## Develop

From this `desktop` directory:

```powershell
npm install
npm run desktop:dev
```

The first Rust build downloads crates and takes longer. Closing the window hides it; use the tray menu to reopen or quit it.

## Compile installers

```powershell
npm run desktop:build
```

The executable and installers are written below `src-tauri\target\release`. Tauri generates NSIS `.exe` and WiX `.msi` installers; it does not currently generate MSIX packages directly.

Run the Laravel migration before pairing a desktop client:

```powershell
php artisan migrate
```

For desktop activity, only the friendly application name, executable filename, client ID, observation time, and accumulated duration are sent. Full executable paths and window titles remain local. Amazon credentials and cookie values stay inside the app's WebView2 profile; Kindle uploads contain only title, author, ASIN, percentage or location, client ID, and observation time.

The app name, bundle identifier, publisher, icons, and signing configuration in `src-tauri\tauri.conf.json` are development placeholders. Replace them with the final reserved product identity before publishing.
